Hello, I'm m654 (/u/m654zy) and today I'll be showcasing some of the changes made to Sapmi and the Hanseatic League. Let's start with the new Sapmi mission tree!

# Sapmi
---

The start of the tree focuses on modernizing and uniting the Sami tribes. After this, you're faced with a difficult decision: adopt Christianity (Catholic or Orthodox), or continue worshipping the old gods? Other parts of the tree focus on conquering Scandinavia, developing your economy and dominating trade in Northern Europe. If you have any suggestions for the tree, be sure to tell me!

# New Suomenusko mechanics
---

Speaking of religion, let's take a look at the Suomenusko religion, which has been updated to use the personal deities mechanic. Each time your ruler dies and is succeeded by your heir, you can choose from 5 (a sixth one might be added later) personal deities that give you different kinds of bonuses.

Now, let's move south and talk a little about the Hanseatic League.

# Hanseatic League
---

One member of the Hanseatic League now acts as the League's leader. The leader can invite new members to the League and kick existing members out (although the other members won't like that). They can also pass *Hanseatic Reforms*, which we will discuss later. In addition to this, the leader gets a few trade and prestige-related modifiers. In the beginning of the game, Lübeck is the leader.

How do you become the leader? It depends on what year it is.

- If it's 1356-1450, you have to either
  - Be Lübeck
  - Have a monthly income of over 2.5 ducats
  - Own 2 or more provinces
- If it's 1450-1600, you have to either
  - Have a monthly income of over 8 ducats
  - Own 5 or more provinces
- If it's 1600-1821, you have to either
  - Have a monthly income of over 15 ducats
  - Own 10 or more provinces

If your country is part of the League and fulfills all of these conditions, you can simply take a decision and pay 1000 ducats. Congratulations, you're now the new leader! That's all well and good, but how will you take advantage of this?


# Hanseatic Reforms
---

Hanseatic Reforms work much like Imperial Reforms in the HRE. There are six reforms in total. Each reform gives the leader, and in the case of the first three, other members various bonuses. The leader can try to enact the reform by taking the decision. Next, each member can choose to either support or oppose the reform. If a country opposes the reform and the leader enacts it anyway, the leader will suffer a severe opinion penalty with that member. Once the reform has been enacted, the next one can't be enacted until 30 years have passed and you have at least +100 relations with each non-rival member of the League.

Here is a list of all of the reforms:

- Unify the Hanseatic Circles
	- Leader: -5% construction cost
	- Members: -5% construction cost
- Hanseatic Army
	- Leader: -25% global regiment cost, +25% manpower recovery speed
	- Members: -10% global regiment cost, +10% manpower recovery speed, *must* donate gold to other members if they are attacked
- Reform the League
	- Leader: +0.5 yearly legitimacy, +1 diplomatic reputation
	- Members: +1 diplomatic reputation, cannot establish *Kontore* on their own
- Revoke Privileges
	- Leader: is leader for the rest of the game, or until the League is dismantled
	- Members: will be given the choice to become vassals of the leader or leave the League altogether
- Leave the Empire
	- Leader: leaves the HRE
	- Members: leave the HRE
- Unify the League
	- Leader: inherits all vassals, tag changes to Hansa, loses all reform bonuses
	- Members: inherited by leader
