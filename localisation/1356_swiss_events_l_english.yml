 swiss_event.1.d: "The Swiss Confederacy has grown since its inception by quite a lot, and it would be a shame if that progress was halted by a few rebellious cantons. Therefore, we will need to devise a way to prevent internal conflict, and get the other cantons to agree to it. Fortunately, the bright minds in our country have created the Pfaffenbrief, a document which states that the cantons of Switzerland function as a single unit. Although this will not unite the country literally, it creates a sense of unity among the different cantons."
