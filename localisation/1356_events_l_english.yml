 hansa.9.d: "Hansa reforms work much like Imperial reforms in the HRE. There are six in total, and they can only be passed by the current leader of the Hanseatic League.

To have a better chance of the other members supporting your reform, improve relations with them. Next, two new decisions will appear: Pass Reform and Cancel Reform. Cancel Reform will simply cancel the pending reform, and allow you to attempt to pass it again at a later date. Pass Reform will actually enact it. If you pass the reform, the members that opposed it will get a -100 opinion penalty with you, and you will not be able to pass another reform for 30 years. Reform 1 gives a -10% build cost reduction. Reform 2 gives -25 regiment cost reduction and 10% manpower recovery speed increase. Reform 3 gives you 1 diplomatic reputation. Passing Reform 4 will let each member either become your vassal or leave the League. Reform 5 makes every member leave the Empire, and finally Reform 6 unifies the League under its current ruler."

 flavor_fla_fra.1.d: "In the year 1349 Humbert II of Viennois sold Dauphine to King Phillip VI of France for 400,000 Écus 'Coin' and an annual pension. Humbert had already proven himself incompitent and extravagant, so in order to preserve his bruised ego it was called a Transfer. In order to prevent Dauphine from fading into just another title under the French King's belt he passed the 'Delphinal Staute.' This made Dauphine exempt from many taxes and gave it a higher degree of autonomy than other french dukes and crown counties. Now the time has come to integrate Dauphine fully into our nation. Historically Louis XI administered his territory directly in Dauphine, and fully integrated Dauphine into France when he became King. He lifted the state from near anarchy and developed the province. Now we have the choice, do we follow Louis XI's route and make Dauphine fully integrated with some exceptions from typical state duties, or do we forceably integrate them with no care for the population?

However...he was not satisfied. That night he had a dream, one where Charlamagne himself spoke to him. Charlamagne told Charles II that he was his ancestor and Charles II should claim whats rightfully his. On waking up Charles II talked to his closest advisors and asked them to spend every waking minute searching for 'Proof' Charles II was decended from Charlamagne. While they did that, Charles took it on himself to have him and his dynasty march their way through Western Europe and conquer all the Kingdoms that once laid under Charlamagnes mighty empire. Even if Charles II wouldnt end up making it, he knew one of his family members would. And so today we celebrate the coronation of $MONARCH$ as the new $MONARCHTITLE$ of Francia!"
 feudalvassalevents.1.t: "Illegal Vassal Type"
 feudalvassalevents.1.desc: "Somehow you've come into control of a Feudal Vassal. This Vassal type is currently only intended to be used by the King of France and anyone else owning them results in a vassal that you can not annex. As a result of this all vassals that are Feudal Vassals will now be changed into regular vassals."
 feudalvassalevents.1.a: "Oh, okay."
 feudalvassalevents.2.t: "The End of the Feudal Era?"
 feudalvassalevents.2.desc: "It's well past the height of the Feudal era, and it is about time to say goodbye as Feudalism gives way to other ways of ruling!"
 feudalvassalevents.2.a: "It's the end of an Era!"
 feudalvassalevents.3.t: "Our overlord the King of France is at war!"
 feudalvassalevents.3.desc: "Our overlord the King of France is at war, and has called on all of his vassals to aid him in this endeavor! We have the option of joining him and leading our soldiers ourself, or sending some troops and ducats his way and let him asign a leader to them. Either way, we are expected to contribute in some way."
 feudalvassalevents.3.a: "We shall join our overlord in this war!"
 feudalvassalevents.3.b: "We're too busy, offer some troops and money instead."
 fre_disaster_civil_war.1.t: "Collapse of the French Kingdom"
 fre_disaster_civil_war.1.desc: "With the lack of a legitimate monarch the Kingdom of France has began to suffer instability and strife within itself. Our spies bring us word that the Nobles, Merchants, Dukes, and Counts all have began to plot against the King and plan to split from his grasp all at once. This not only prevents the monarch from doing anything, but this also effectivly renders the Kingdom of France no more!"
 fre_disaster_civil_war.1.a: "Well, shit."
 fre_disaster_civil_war.2.t: "End of the French Civil War"
 fre_disaster_civil_war.2.desc: "This event just forces the civil war to be over for Valois."

 fre_disaster_civil_war.3.t: "The Holy Roman Emperor Offers Vassalization"
 fre_disaster_civil_war.3.desc: "Now that we are independent from the former Kingdom of France we have two choices! We can either stay independent and attempt to claim the crown of France, or we can accept the offer to become vassals of the Holy Roman Empire. The Emperor has promised to give us the same rights as all the other German and Italian subjects! We also have the added bonus that the Emperor promises to protect us from anyone outside the HRE who would wish to remove our duchy from our control! Joining the HRE is the obvious easy way out, but retaking our crown without the help of the Empire would be very rewarding and prestigious..."
 fre_disaster_civil_war.3.a: "Never! We stay Independent!"
 fre_disaster_civil_war.3.b: "Yes! Vassalization shall protect us from the English and the Iberians!"
 fre_disaster_civil_war.4.t: "The Collapse of the French Kingdom"
 fre_disaster_civil_war.4.desc: "Now that the Kingdom of France has coallapsed from inside due to lack of a legitimate monarch we have a ripe opportunity! We can offer vassalization to the former vassals of the Kingdom of France and retake the provinces we lost during the 9th century when the land split from Karling control! However doing this would add a lot more land for us to administrate, provide protection and aid to. This is the perfect time to send this offer! But we must act fast, as the longer we take the bigger they grow."
 fre_disaster_civil_war.4.a: "We happily extend an offer of vassalization to all former members of the Kingdom of France!"
 fre_disaster_civil_war.4.b: "Bah! The French are better off on their own, when have they helped us?"
 fre_disaster_civil_war.5.t: "A French Duke Accepts!"
 fre_disaster_civil_war.5.desc: "One of the French Dukes has accepted our offer! We're sure now that because of this our Imperial Legitimacy will rise!"
 fre_disaster_civil_war.5.a: "Amazing! We must arrange a meeting between us sometime soon!"
 fre_disaster_civil_war.6.t: "A French Duke has Declined!"
 fre_disaster_civil_war.6.desc: "One of the French Dukes has declined our offer! Hopefully this won't lower our legitimacy as a result of this..."
 fre_disaster_civil_war.6.a: "Bah! We didn't need them anyways."
 eastereggflandy.1.t: "The Rise of the van Vladderen family..."
 eastereggflandy.1.desc: "As of recent, a rich merchant family in Vladderen have been making their rounds in the local gossip. Word has it the Elder van Vladderen has arranged a marriage between his first son and a nearby royal family. Now the locals are basically worshiping them like some sort of weird cult. It's only made worse by the fact that the Elder van Vladderen is claiming to be a decendent of a distant relative of ours that stole the throne from their mutual relative of ours! The peasants are now up in arms and may revolt if we do not act fast. Perhaps it may be safer for us to step down before we are killed in our own castle? "
 eastereggflandy.1.a: "You dirty peasants win! The van Vladderens now rule over you. Now maybe I can retire..."
 eastereggflandy.1.b: "This is nonsense! Throw these dirty peasants in the dungeon, as well as the van Vladderens!"
 eastereggflandy.2.t: "Mysterious Deaths in the Family..."
 eastereggflandy.2.desc: "Mysteriously our first two sons have died, now leaving Count Flandy, our third son, next in line to inherit the throne. However he's a bit of a backstabbing weasel, who can't quite be trusted. We suspect that he may be the one behind the death of our first and second sons. However we don't have any proof so we can't quite touch him without widespread consequences. Thankfuly we do happen to have a fourth son, but he's still quite young and not exactly ready for the throne. What are we to do?"
 eastereggflandy.2.a: "Name Count Flandy our new heir."
 eastereggflandy.2.b: "While he can't be trusted with the throne, he'd make a fine advisor!"
 eastereggflandy.2.c: "It was him! He was the one who killed our first two sons! Kill him!"
 eastereggflandy.2.d: "It's a good thing we have 4 son's, right?"
