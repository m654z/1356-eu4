 oi_name: "The Ottoman Interregnum"
 oi_desc: "The Ottoman Interregnum, or the Ottoman Civil War, began on 20 July 1402, when chaos reigned in the Ottoman Empire following the defeat of Sultan Bayezid I by the Central Asian warlord Timur. Although Mehmed Çelebi was confirmed as sultan by Timur, his brothers refused to recognize his authority. Today's date is 21st March 1405, and Timur draws his last breath. In the west, John the Fearless of Burgundy inherits the Duchy of Flanders from his mother and begins the ascension of the Grand Duchy of the West. The Byzantines, clinging to what little remains of their once sprawling empire, have a short respite, but can they take advantage of the situation and finally drive the Turks out of Europe?"

 tt_name: "The Treaty of Troyes"
 tt_desc: "The Treaty of Troyes was an agreement that Henry V of England and his heirs would inherit the throne of France upon the death of King Charles VI of France. It was signed in the French city of Troyes on 21 May 1420 in the aftermath of the Battle of Agincourt. Whilst, officially, the war ended for a few months, fighting never ceased and the treaty was undermined by the deaths of both Charles VI and Henry V within two months of each other in 1422. It forms a part of the backdrop of the latter phase of the Hundred Years' War, in which various English kings tried to establish their claims to the French throne."
