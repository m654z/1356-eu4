 string_start_england:0 "In [GetYear] the Kingdom of §YEngland§! holds the upper hand in the war against §YFrance§!. After defeating a numerically superior French army at the Battle of Poitiers, the English now hold the French king §YJean II§! and his son Philippe the Bold captive, leaving the Dauphin §YCharles§! as regent.\n\nThis phase of the war has gone well for the English. After the Black Death brought the war to a halt for the previous few years, the campaign has been renewed once more by King §YEdward III§!'s son, §YEdward 'The Black Prince'§!, who in 1355 led a series of devastating raids across the south of France, known as 'chevauchée'. The chevauchée have destroyed hundreds of villages, towns, cities and castles, and the pillaging done to the agricultural infrastructure of the region has left the countryside utterly desolated. The French economy is in ruins, and local nobles have proven unwilling to come to the aid of their subjects, leaving much of the peasantry agitated.\n\nAlong with the terrible destruction has come great benefit to the Anglo and §YGascon§! invaders. The devestation of the French land and army has allowed the English to occupy large swathes of France and are now perfectly positioned to encroach further on Paris, or secure the southern cities of Narbonne and Montpellier. Regardless of the direction of future occupation, the strong position the English find themselves in means that they are almost sure to achieve victory, and most likely make demands of territorial concessions to their Gascon allies.\n\nAcross the Channel it is also smooth sailing. The §YScottish§! threat has been neutralised for the time being after the capture of the King of Scots, §YDaibhid II§! at the Battle of Neville's Cross. The lords in §YWales§!, §YNorthumberland§!, §YLancaster§! and §YKildare§! have stayed content, although how long their current autonomy will be upheld remains to be seen. The only hiccup is the increasing popularity of a new brand of heresy, Lollardism. For now however, the heretics are peaceful, and Britons can safely assume that for the coming decades if not centures, they will never be slaves."
 string_start_france:0 "In [GetYear] the Kingdom of §YFrance§! is still recovering after the disastrous Battle of Poitiers, part of the Edwardian phase of the Hundred Years’ War. King §YJean II§! and his son Phillippe the Bold have been captured alongside large swathes of the French nobility at the Battle of Poitiers, leaving heir to the throne §YCharles§! to assume the powers of regent as the government collapses around him.\n\nThis phase of the war has not gone well for the French. The §YEnglish§! are on the offensive once more, after a lull in the fighting during the previous years as the Black Death swept through Europe. The English are performing a brutal campaign of raids known as 'chevauchee', looting and pillaging in an attempt to demoralise the French people and drain the French treasury.\n\nEven if France is to push back the English advances and kick them off the continent, there are other issues facing the kingdom. The Hundred Years’ War also encompasses ‘The War of the Two Peters’, and ‘The War of Breton Succession’, civil wars in the Kingdom of §YCastile§! and the Duchy of §YBritanny§! respectively. Internal issues are rampant also, with a refusal of the Etats Generaux to co-operate with the Dauphin, and numerous autonomous lords in need of proper integration.\n\nShould the Dauphin and his successors weather the storm however, they would find themselves as one of the most powerful kingdoms in Europe, with opportunity for expansion into the Low Countries, North Italy, or even Germany, should they dare to take on the might of the  §YHoly Roman Empire§!. The possibilities for a unified France are limitless, and an ambitious monarch could go so far as to conquer Europe and once again create a French Empire, the likes of which has never been seen since the days of Charlemagne."
