# 1356-eu4
A mod for the game Europa Universalis IV that extends the timeline back to the signing of Charles IV's Golden Bull in 1356.

### Future plans
- Fix the rest of the minor bugs
- Add events related to the rise of certain countries in the 1356-1444 time period (Timurid, Ottoman, Muscovy)
- Add events related to the *fall* of certain countries (Golden Horde, Yuan?)
- Add flavor events and updated missions for most major countries
- Focus on regions that haven't been given much attention (Africa, Americas)
